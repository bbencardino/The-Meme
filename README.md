This project is an exercise from the Udacity's iOS Nanodegree. It covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.




# What is it?

It's an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.
